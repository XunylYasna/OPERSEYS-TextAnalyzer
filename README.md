# OPERSYS-TextAnalyzer 

## Introduction
The project for this course is a text analyzer.  A text analyzer give back the text statistics of a text file like number of words and sentences in the whole document.  In counting the statistics, the program can use multiple threads to count the number of words or other statistics.  Using multiple threads will be faster than a program using a single thread.
